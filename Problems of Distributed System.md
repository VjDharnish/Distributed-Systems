## Troubles in Distributed Systems
	Network failure
		High latency
		When a system is divided into two separate parts , communication between those two becomes unreliable and unavailable
	Resource Utilization
		nodes having different capabilities or resources
	Processing sensistive data among nodes
	
## Handling Unreliable Network
	Redundant communication between nodes
	Timeout and fallback mechanism
	Network monitoring

## Maintaining Data Consistency
	Consensus algorithm
	Enable data versioning
